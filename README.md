# Segeeslice's NVIM Config

This is my NVIM config! Made primarily for personal use with [Neovim](https://neovim.io) across all of my devices. Includes various custom features and functionalities that I've compiled to improve upon my personal programming experience.

This is the part where I'd list the features if it was worth the effort... :P

In any case, feel free to look through and see what I have! It's commented enough to understand the intent. Just be sure to have the **pre-requisites** as listed below. Otherwise, if you're interested in the configuration, you probably know enough about VIM to get the gist.

Enjoy :)

## Pre-requisites
- [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed in nvim config directory
  - See `install-vim-plug.ps1` in this repo for easy Windows installation
- [The silver surfer](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed and added to PATH
  - Installation details on the site (no easy way to make a script in this repo)
