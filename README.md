# Segeeslice's VIM Config

This is my VIM config! Primarily for personal use with [Neovim](https://neovim.io) across all of my devices. Includes various custom features and functionalities that I've compiled to improve upon my personal programming experience.

This is the part where I'd list the features if it was worth the effort... :P

In any case, feel free to look through and see what I have! It's commented enough to understand the intent. The only special thing to note is that it requires custom installation of [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plugg). Otherwise if you're curious in the configuration, you probably know enough about VIM to get the gist.

Enjoy your stay :)
